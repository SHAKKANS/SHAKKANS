 Hi there 👋

👋 I am an enthusiastic Software Quality Professional with a zest for delivering quality products, using rigorous quality assurance processes and leveraging technology and tools.👋

      💡 When it comes to testing a piece of software, I am a curious person and go out of the box thinking to find the nonconformance in the system and report
         it before the customer catches it.
      🌱 I’m currently developing end-to-end automation scripts for online shopping using Selenium, Java and TestNG.
      👯 I always look to collaborate with the team and think of ways how testing be made more efficient with the help of integration of technology, tools and processes.
      🔭 Excited to learn and explore new Software testing trends, technologies and tools and how these can benefit in Software Testing.
      🗞️ My other areas of expertise include Agile Project Management and Scrum Framework, monitoring the Sprint development and progress.
      🤔 Some of the areas where I might need help are the DevOps Integration Pipeline, and Application network infrastructure.
      💬 Ask me about how to implement a Quality Assurance Process, Test Management, Defect Management, Agile Scrum Framework and Project Management tools such as Jira,I am 
          happy to help.
